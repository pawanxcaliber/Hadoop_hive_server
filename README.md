# docker-hive

This is a docker container for Apache Hive 2.3.2. It is based on https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop so check there for Hadoop configurations.
This deploys Hive and starts a hiveserver2 on port 10000.
Metastore is running with a connection to postgresql database.
The hive configuration is performed with HIVE_SITE_CONF_ variables (see hadoop-hive.env for an example).

To run Hive with postgresql metastore:
```
   python container_start.py
```
